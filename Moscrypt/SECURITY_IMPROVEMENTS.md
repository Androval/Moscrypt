# Security Improvements: Password Storage and Handling

This document was generated by AI

This document explains the security improvements made to Moscrypt's password handling and authentication system.

## Implemented Security Features

### 1. Enhanced Password Storage
- Individual salts for each user's password hash
- Salt storage separated from password hash
- Using bcrypt for secure, slow hashing algorithm with work factor

### 2. Brute Force Protection
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
- 15-minute lockout period for security
- Failed login tracking and logging

### 3. Session Security
- 1-hour session expiration
- Session identifier to prevent session fixation attacks
- Secure cookie settings with SameSite=Lax and HttpOnly flags

### 4. CSRF Protection
- Implementation of Flask-WTF for CSRF token generation and validation
- CSRF tokens required for all POST requests
- Automatic CSRF validation on form submissions

### 5. Improved Logging
- Security event logging for login attempts, password changes, user creation
- Log redaction for sensitive information
- No credentials printed to console

### 6. Password Policy Enforcement
- Minimum 8-character password length
- Requires uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Password change history (for future password rotation policy)

## Migration Process

For existing database users, a migration script (`migrate_db.py`) has been created to:

1. Add new security-related columns to the User table
2. Extract existing salts from bcrypt hashes where possible
3. Set default values for security tracking fields
4. Mark accounts for password reset when necessary

## How to Apply the Migration

To update your existing database with these security enhancements:

1. Update your code with the new security features
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the migration script:
   ```
   python migrate_db.py
   ```
4. Restart the application server

## Security Best Practices

- Regularly rotate the application's master encryption key
- Implement password expiration (e.g., prompt for change after 90 days)
- Consider implementing multi-factor authentication
- Regularly audit login logs for suspicious activity
- Keep all dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities
